# IDENTIFICATION OF SCGB1A1 GENE IN GALLIFORMES

The evolution of water-breathing gills to air-breathing lungs is associated with various functions across the vertebrate species. The avian respiratory system has been the evolutionary zenith among the air-breathing vertebrates. Features like rigid lungs, the absence of a diaphragm, and the presence of air sacs provide them with a varied system compared to humans. The Club Cells secrete the Uteroglobin protein, expressed by the SCGB1A1 gene. We examined this mammal-exclusive gene in 103 Birds among various families. The genomic blast results have proven the presence of the SCGB1A1 gene in Galliformes, which was later proven by SRA blast. Further to confirm the similarity of the gene, the conservation of syntenic locations is observed. The gene is located between the genes INCENP and TPCN2 in all the Galliformes.
    Gene annotation validation was performed by selecting 1-to-1 orthologs with the highest genome coverage from NCBI and Ensembl for APOC1, APOC2, and SCGB1A1 across six vertebrate gene clades. Open reading frames (ORFs) were extracted using ORFfinder.sh, validated with the Expasy translate tool, and aligned using multiple sequence alignment tools (MUSCLE, ClustalW, PRANK, MAFFT) under Guidance. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with TimeTree and the ‘ape’ R package. Missing or incomplete gene annotations were verified by screening genomes with closely related species via BLAST, cross-checking with raw Illumina and PacBio data from NCBI’s SRA, and ensuring assembly accuracy. Molecular evolutionary analyses quantified GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) using phastbias (PHAST v1.6) and assessed selection pressures using codeml (PAML) and RELAX (HyPhy). Homolog detection for SCGB1A1 was conducted using HHblits with an e-value threshold of 1e-3, identifying protein and RNA homologs across various species.
